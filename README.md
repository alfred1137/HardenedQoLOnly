# Introduction

Hardened is a large overhaul mod for Reforged, offering an alternate vision that stays within the bounds of savegame compatibility.

While Reforged sticks to the vanilla game's vision and focuses on realism, Hardened embraces a simpler, more experimental approach. This submod walks back several of Reforged's complex or restrictive design choices, opting for streamlined systems that prioritize fluidity and player freedom. Hardened also takes more risks with creative design choices, innovative quality of life features and fixes for obscure vanilla bugs or cheese strategies, which can occasionally introduce more bugs or incompatibilities than Reforged.

Hardened reflects my personal vision of Battle Brothers overhaul mod: A balanced, varied, and challenging experience, with enough randomness to keep each playthrough fresh and unpredictable.

# List of all Changes

- Some skills or perks may increase or reduce the Reach of a character
- **Reach** is 0 while the character does not emit a zone of control (e.g. stunned, fleeing, wielding ranged weapon)

### Streamlined Difficulty Scaling

- Most vanilla difficulty scaling methods (day/player strength/renown scaling) are disabled
- Instead the following streamlined system is added:
	- Contracts are 1% more difficult for every 10 Renown, up to a maximum of 1000% more
	- Contracts pay 1% more Crowns for every 10 Renown, up to a maximum of 1000% more

  - Every adjacent ally (except the first two) causes -5% Hitchance with such a skill
  - Every adjacent enemy causes -10% Hitchance with such a skill
  - This effect does not count adjacent characters who are 2 or more levels above or below
- As a consequence of the **Crowded** mechanic, 2-tile melee attacks lose the vanilla hitchance penalty to attack adjacent targets

- Stunning with a Lute no longer grants the Lute Achievement
- Brigand Killer spawning as "Disguised Bandits" in that contract twist, blow the cover when looking at their tooltip
- The first time you open a combat dialog each session: the list of enemies will be very briefly be rendered very small

# Compatibility

## General

- Is safe to remove from- and add to any savegame
- Removing or adding this mod will not update existing perk trees.
	- Only after some days you will encounter brothers with the changed perk trees
	- Perk Groups may not be identified correctly on old brothers after adding or removing this mod. This is just visual
